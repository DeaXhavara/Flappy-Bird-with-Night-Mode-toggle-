# About the Project

This was my **first ever JavaFX project**, built from scratch in **Eclipse IDE**.
It was a personal challenge to explore GUI development and event-driven programming using Java.

I'm passionate to learn more about AI, computing, and creative technology, this is just the start of a much bigger journey.

Feel free to check out the code. Feedback is welcome!
